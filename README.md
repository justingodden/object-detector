# Object Detector

This project was built with React JS and TensorFlow.js, using the [coco-ssd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) model - capable of detection [80 classes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd/src/classes.ts).

The web app is currently only designed for mobile screen sizes, and works best with landscape pictures.
